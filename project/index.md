## Abstract

Here comes a short abstract of the project that summarizes what it is about

Contents

**Keywords:** ai, data science, disease, COVID-19.

## 1. Introduction

Do not include this tip in your document:
- [ ] Find literature about AI and healthcare disparities
- [ ] Find literature about AI and COVID-19
- [ ] Analyze the literature and explain how data science, ai is better to healthcare.

## 2. Datasets
- [ ] Finding datasets in orthodontics
- [ ] Can any of the datasets be used in AI?
- [ ] What are the challenges with Healthcare dataset? Privacy, Inconsistent Dataset
- [ ] Datasets can be huge and GitHub has limited space. Only very small datasets should be stored in GitHub.
      However, if the data is publicly available you program must contain a download function instead that you customize.
      Write it using pythons `request`. You will get point deductions if you check-in data sets that are large and do not use
      the download function.

## 3. Using Images
- [ ] Place a cool image into projects images in my directory
- [ ] Correct the following link, replace the fa number with my su number and the chart of png
- [ ] If the image has been copied, I must use a reference as shown in the Figure 1 caption
- 
![Figure 1](https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/fa20-523-314/raw/main/project/images/chart.png)

**Figure 1:** Images can be included in the report, but if they are copied you must cite them [^1].\

## 5. Example of an AI algorithm in Healthcare
- [ ] Identify the concrete datasets that will be used.
- [ ] Identify the concrete algorithm that is used to analyze the datasets
- [ ] Write the program
- [ ] Verify that it works
   
## 6. Benchmark

Your project must include a benchmark. The easiest is to use cloudmesh-common [^2]
 
## 6. Conclusion

A convincing but not fake conclusion should summarize what the conclusion of the project is.

## 8. Acknowledgments
- [ ] Gregor guided me through this process
Please add acknowledgments to all that contributed or helped on this project.  

## 9. References

- [ ] Your report must include at least 6 references. Please use customary academic citation and not just URLs. As we will at 
      one point automatically change the references from superscript to square brackets it is best to introduce a space before 
      the first square bracket.
